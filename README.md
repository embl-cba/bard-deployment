# BARD Desktop # 
BARD is a virtual desktop platform based on Kubernetes, developed for cloud-based bioimage analysis tasks. 
It was developed based on the open-source project [abcdesktop](https://abcdesktop.io). 
Everything in BARD, such as applications, system APIs etc are docker containers.

## Applications
All applications on BARD are standard containers with some BARD specifics, such as LABEL etc.
You can find all the application containers [here](https://github.com/embl-cba/bard-containers)

## Current Deployments ##
- EMBL internal BARD: https://bard.embl.de (used by EMBL staff for day-to-day image analysis)
- EMBL external BARD: https://bard-external.embl.de (used for external courses)
  
## Deploy your own BARD ##
1. [Install Kubernetes cluster](install-k8s.md) (optional if you already have a cluster)
2. [Deploy BARD](deploy-bard.md)
